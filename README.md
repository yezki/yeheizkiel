# Hello there 👋, and welcome to my profile!

#### Let me introduce myself :relieved: :

&emsp;&emsp;My name is Yeheizkiel Gabriel and I'am 19 years old Beginner-to-Intermediate Software Developer from Indonesia. You can call me by my first name, or just "Yezki" / "Yeski". Currently I'm working as a Freelance Website Developer at home in Jember - East Java.
  
&emsp;&emsp;I can speak at least 5 languages: Javanese, Indonesian, Malay, English, and Japanese. I love learning foreign languages especially English & Japanese, watching Sci-Fi Films & Japanese Anime, playing Chess & Rubik. As a side-work, I have joined & still contribute an open source project regarding database of information on animation shows from various countries and sites, called [Ryuuganime](https://github.com/ryuuganime "Open-source Anime Database Project"), which is owned by [Nattadasu](https://github.com/nattadasu "The owner of Ryuuganime Project").

&emsp;&emsp;I'm currently learning React.js, Node.js, and Express.js, trying to get to know about MERN Stack and also UI/UX Design, so that I can design my own website & future projects more better. 😄

&emsp;&emsp;If you have any question for me regarding of works, collaboration or just want to talk to me, feel free to [create an Issue in this repository](https://github.com/yeheizkiel/yeheizkiel/issues/new).
